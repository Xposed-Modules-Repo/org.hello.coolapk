# FuckCoolapk

Requirements:
```
latest LSPosed
```

Supported version: only support Coolapk with 360jiagu and test yourself. Coolapk 12.0.2 works on my devices.

This module has these features:

- No News Feed Ads
- Reject append shareUid and shareFrom when sharing a link
- TODO soon...

These features won't be added(maybe):

- Remove Ads when app start

To hide the module, you can try 
```shell
su -c pm hide org.hello.coolapk
```
or you can use HMA(Hide-My-Applist) or else.
