### The setting ui is in the settings activity of Coolapk.

Requirements:

```

Some features may not work in some versions of Coolapk, so test it yourself.

This module has these features:

- No News Feed Ads
- Reject append shareUid and shareFrom when sharing a link
- change UserName if the feed is abnormal
- No "Mentioned Goods" in Feed
